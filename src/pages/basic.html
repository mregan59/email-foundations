                    Dear&nbsp;*|FNAME|*,<br>
                    <br>
                    Often, that's exactly how rejection leaves
                    us feeling.<br>
                    <br>
                    But, as awful as it is, rejection is unavoidable.<br>
                    <br>
                    Not everybody will want to date you. Some of your
                    friendships will end. Jobs will turn you down. You won't
                    always get your way.<br>
                    <br>
                    But, that's okay.<br>
                    <br>
                    Don’t let those rejections make you believe the lie that
                    you’re fundamentally flawed or unworthy.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you struggle with doing that, remember this: <br> <br>
                    <em>You’re so worthy that Jesus died for
                        you.</em>
                    <br> <br>
                    And, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Romans
                    8:31).<br>
                    <br>
                    You should remind yourself of those realities because
                    they are just as real as the rejections that you will
                    inevitably experience.<br>
                    <br>
                    Keep reading for this week's collection of articles
                    (including one about managing rejection with
                    grace)!&nbsp;

                <p> Don't forget, as much as rejection, heartbreak, and loss
                    can hurt...we don't always know in the moment what is
                    best for us.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    But, God does.<br>
                    <br>
                    So, when He closes a door, even a door you wanted open
                    SO BADLY, remember, He knows what is best for you.<br>
                    <br>
                    And, the best is yet to come!<br>
                    <br>
